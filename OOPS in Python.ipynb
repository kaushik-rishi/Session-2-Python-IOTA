    "- Understand the basics of Object oriented programming (Advantages of it over procedural programming)\n",
    "- Understand Classes and Objects.\n",
    "    - `self` keyword\n",
    "    - Methods\n",
    "    - Properties\n",
    "    - `__init__` constructor \n",
    "- Dunder Methods (Special Methods)\n",
    "- Inheritance\n",
    "    - How it works?\n",
    "    - the `super` keyword\n",

    "#### Is Python Object Oriented?\n",
    "\n",
    "Short answer : Yes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python follows Object-oriented programming paradigm. Which means that Python has classes, inheritance, and all the usual OOPs concepts with the exception of the ability to use the private keyword with variables in classes."
